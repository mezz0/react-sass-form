# React Form

To get started:
- run `npm install` at the root of the project
- next, `npm start`. This should run the project in browser at "http://localhost:3000/"

# Dependancies

I have used the following packages:
- Typescript
- React
- React Helmet Async
- Redux (not used, but it is set up in case it is needed to handle state)
- Sass
- Styled-Components
- Prettier (to use: `npx prettier --write .`)
